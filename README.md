# frevel

This is a basic fork of [Revel](https://github.com/revel) to get around a dependency issue that the maintainers refuse to fix after many many months.

# f revel?

This is only needed temporarily for my use case - I highly recommend anyone looking to start green field web projects in Go to take a look at [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo).

# fork revel?

Feel free to read the name as "Fork Revel" or any other F-word you may deem appropriate.
