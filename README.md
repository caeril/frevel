# frevel

This is a basic fork of github.com/revel to get around a dependency issue that the maintainers refuse to fix after many many months.

This is only needed temporarily - I highly recommend anyone looking to start green field web projects in Go with Echo.

Feel free to read the name as "Fork Revel" or any other F-word you may deem appropriate.
